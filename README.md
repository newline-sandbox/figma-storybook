# Figma and Storybook

This project demonstrates how to add the [`storybook-addon-designs`](https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-designs) addon to Storybook to embed Figma files directly into the Storybook UI.

*Note*: Replace the `.env.sample` file with a `.env` file, and set the `STORYBOOK_FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable to an access token generated from your Figma account.

## Running Storybook
